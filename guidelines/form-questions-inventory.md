- If both parents abandoned → simpler SIJS narrative

### Validation Rules:
- Minor must be under 21 for SIJS
- Minor must be unmarried
- Guardian must be 18+
- Dates must be logical (birth before death, etc.)
- At least one parent must have "no reunification" for SIJS

### Form-Specific Requirements:

#### GC-210 (Petition for Appointment)
- Requires full legal names (no nicknames)
- Addresses must be complete (no PO boxes for residence)
- Must specify type of guardianship (person only for SIJS)

#### GC-210(CA) (Child Information Attachment)

- Must list ALL addresses for past 5 years
- Requires specific dates (month/year minimum)

### Data Collection Best Practices:
1. Collect full legal names (check ID/birth certificate)
2. Get exact addresses (use Google Maps for verification)
3. Document dates as specifically as possible
4. Prepare narrative explanations in advance
5. Have supporting documents ready (death certificates, police reports)
6. Collect more info than needed (better to have it)

### Interview Flow Optimization:
1. Start with minor's basic info (builds rapport)
2. Move to guardian (positive focus)
3. Then tackle difficult parent questions
4. End with procedural items
5. Review all before submission

### Spanish Translation Considerations:
Priority fields for translation (most confusing):
- Legal status questions
- Abuse/neglect terminology
- Court procedure explanations
- Rights and consent sections
- Time period calculations

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Incomplete addresses (missing apartment numbers)
- Inconsistent name spelling
- Wrong court address for filing
- Missing required notices
- Inadequate SIJS basis explanation
- Forgetting to check for tribal affiliation
- Not listing all prior addresses

## DATA COLLECTION REALITY

### Typical Intake Timeline
**Session 1 (30-45 min)**: Initial phone/in-person interview
- Minor's basic information
- Guardian information  
- General story about parents
- Missing: Specific dates, addresses, documents

**Session 2 (15-20 min)**: Follow-up call
- Birth certificate obtained → correct spelling, birth place
- Death certificates → exact dates
- Previous addresses from school records

**Session 3 (10 min)**: Final details
- Parent's last known addresses from relatives
- Court case numbers from online search
- Missing sibling information located

**Email exchanges**: Various documents trickle in
- Photos of documents
- Corrections to names/dates
- Additional details remembered

### Fields Often Requiring Follow-up
**Most commonly incomplete**:
1. Parent's exact date of birth (often just year)
2. Parent's last known address (especially if abroad)
3. Dates of last contact (usually "a few years ago")
4. Previous addresses with exact dates
5. Sibling information (forgotten initially)
6. Case numbers from other proceedings
7. Exact spelling of foreign names
8. Death certificate information

### Smart Default Handling
**For unknown but required fields**:
- Father's DOB: "Unknown, approximately [year] based on age"
- Last contact date: "On or about [month/year]"
- Foreign address: "[City, Country] - exact address unknown"
- Parent whereabouts: "Unknown, last known to be in [country]"

### Progressive Data Enhancement
1. **Can file with**: Basic minor info, guardian info, general parent status
2. **Better with**: Specific dates, full addresses, supporting documents
3. **Best with**: Everything documented, all addresses verified, all dates confirmed

### Data Validation Levels
**STRICT (blocks form generation)**:
- Minor's name and DOB
- Guardian's name and address
- At least one parent's basic info
- SIJS grounds (abuse/neglect/abandonment)

**FLEXIBLE (warns but allows)**:
- Parent's exact DOB
- Previous addresses dates
- Sibling details
- Phone numbers

**OPTIONAL (nice to have)**:
- SSN/A-Numbers
- Email addresses
- Employer information
- School details

### Auto-Save Strategy
```javascript
// Save on every field blur, not just section completion
// This captures partial phone numbers, half-written addresses, etc.

onBlur={(e) => {
  // Save even partial data
  updateFormData({
    [fieldName]: e.target.value || ''
  });
}}

// Show save indicator
{isSaving && <Spinner />}
{!isSaving && lastSaved && (
  <span>Saved {formatRelativeTime(lastSaved)}</span>
)}
```

### Incomplete Data Indicators
**Per Section**:
- ✓ Complete (all required fields)
- ⚠️ Partial (some required missing)
- ⚪ Not started

**Per Field**:
- Red asterisk = Required for filing
- Yellow asterisk = Recommended
- No asterisk = Optional

**Smart Warnings**:
- "Generate anyway" button if only recommended fields missing
